                            <p id="about-content">
                                <p>a computer scientist with a strong background in the exciting world of technology. With a degree in Computer Science (ULPGC) and a Master's degree in "Intelligent Systems and Numerical Applications" (SIANI - ULPGC), I have developed skills in the field of machine learning and robotics, where my passion lies in creating revolutionary solutions that integrate artificial intelligence with engineering to significantly transform our environment. I have had the privilege of working in dynamic and collaborative environments, which has strengthened my ability to communicate effectively and work in teams.</p>
                                <p>In addition to my technical expertise, I have a proactive approach to continuous learning and constantly updating my skills to keep up with the latest trends in the industry. Currently, I am engaged in pursuing my PhD, specializing in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and business field.</p>
                                <p>When I am not coding, I explore a diversity of activities that enrich my life. In addition, I find balance in sports, which not only keep me fit, but also help me recharge and stay focused. In my peaceful moments, I enjoy creative activities, which allow me to disconnect and develop my artistic side.</p>
                                <p>I eagerly look forward to the opportunity to bring my experience and passion to teams that value technical excellence and creativity in the field of computer engineering.</p>
                                <p>Feel free to say hello. I'll be excited to hear from you.</p>
                                <p>Take care and stay awesome!</p>
                            </p>
